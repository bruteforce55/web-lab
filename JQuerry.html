    <p>jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree
        traversal and manipulation, as well event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.
        It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License. As of May
        2019, jQuery is used by 73% 10 million most popular websites. Web analysis
        indicates that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large
        margin, having 3 to 4 times more usage than any other JavaScript library.
    </p>
    <p>
        The set of jQuery core features—DOM element selections, traversal and
        manipulationions,—enabled by its selector engine (named "Sizzle" from v1.3),
        created a "new programming style", fusing algorithms and DOM data
        structures. This style influenced the architecture of other JavaScript frameworks
        like YUI v3 andDojo, later stimulating the creation of standard Selectors API.
